# [SGC Challenge](https://https://github.com/Araggar/sgc-challenge)

Hello there!

The campaign for this selection was inspired by the Mission Impossible movies. The character we presented on our banner is called Luther Stickell. 

"He is a senior intelligence operative and computer specialist employed by the Impossible Mission Force and a close friend to Ethan Hunt who joined his team as a disavowed agent during a mission in 1996 and has since returned in all his following missions."

But you're in luck, unlike Luther, you have a very possible challenge to meet.

## Docker

For this challenge you will need to be familiar with the basic docker concepts.

Don't worry, we've prepared some links for you to read.

In addition, Let's look at the main commands you need to run a pre-booted environment.

* [Docker Docs](https://docker-curriculum.com/)

### Docker Quickstart

* Installing Docker (Ubuntu):
  * `sudo apt update`
  * `sudo apt install docker` (you can also install it with: `sudo snap install docker`)

* Starting Docker:
  * `sudo systemctl start docker`
  * `sudo systemctl enable docker`
  
* Verify installation
  * `docker --version`
  * `docker run hello-world`

* Running our container for the first time: 
  * Download the `docker` folder in this repository
  * `cd docker/`
  * `docker build -t sgc .`
  * `docker run --name sgc -ti sgc` or `docker run -ti --name sgc -v ./:/home/labsec/challenge sgc bash`
  
* Running the container afterwards:
  * `docker start sgc`
  * `z`

## Libcryptosec

* [Libcryptosec Docs](https://labsec.github.io/libcryptosec/)
